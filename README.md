Streamlit App exploring Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame 

This app allows users to view a breakdown of Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame membership. The data was collected through baseball-reference.com along with some manual contribution from myself using different data that was also available on baseball-reference.com. The information for the process of the hall of fame voting was obtained from mlb.com and bbwaa.com. In the future I would like to add to breakdown active and future players on the ballot who will have cases to be in the Hall of Fame.

Note: For the dataset, run convert the zip file back to a csv named "baseball_HOF.csv".
